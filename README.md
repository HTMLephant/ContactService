# ContactService
# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  First and foremost, following standard coding practices. After that, different testing methods such as unit testing or regression testing should be used to check the integrity of the work.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Each individual need of the service is met by a dedicated function. For the Contact Service itself, there are three needs: add a contact, delete a contact, and update a contact. Since there are three needs, there are three functions in the ContactService class corresponding to that.

# How do I approach designing software?
  I like to make a template of all the methods I think I will have for the end project, and I will work on one segment at a time.
